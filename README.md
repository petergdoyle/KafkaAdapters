# Kafka-Adapters

A collection of code modules that will take data from one messaging system or protocol and put it to a Kafka topic or to take from Kafka and put into one of those messaging systems. These components are generically referred to as "Adapters" but are based on the[ Messaging Bridge Pattern](http://http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/MessagingBridge.html)

Most of the code is written in Java and uses the Kafka v.0.10.x client APIs. These are documented at the Apaache Kafka site https://kafka.apache.org
